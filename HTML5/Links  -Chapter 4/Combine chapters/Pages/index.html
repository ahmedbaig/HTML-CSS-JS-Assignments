				<h2><i>Everyone Has a Story in Life</i></h2>
				<p>A 24 year old boy seeing out from the train's window shouted.<br></p>
				<p><q>Dad, look the trees are going behind!</q></p>
				
				<p>Dad smiled and a young couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24 year old's childish behavior with pity, suddenly he again exclaimed<br></p>
				
				<p><q>Dad, look the clouds are running with us!</q><br></p>
				
				<p>The couple couldn't resist and said to the old man<br></p>
				
				<p><q>Why don't you take your son to a good doctor?</q>The old man smiled and said <q>I did and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from birth, he just got his eyes today.</q><br></p>
				
				<p>Every single person on the planet has a story. Don't judge people before you truly know them. The truth might surprise you.</p>

				<h2><i>Shake off Your Problems</i></h2>
				
				<p>A man's favorite donkey falls into a deep precipice; He can't pull it out no matter how hard he tries; He therefore decides to bury it alive.</p>
				
				<p>Soil is poured onto the donkey from above. The donkey feels the load, shakes it off, and steps on it; More soil is poured.</p>
				
				<p>It shakes it off and steps up; The more the load was poured, the higher it rose; By noon, the donkey was grazing in green pastures.</p>
				
				<p>After much shaking off (of problems) And stepping up (learning from them), One will graze in GREEN PASTURES.</p>

				<h2><i>Chicken Dum Birani</i></h2>
				<p>
					<ol>
						<li>Wash rice few times till the water runs clear. Soak in ample water for 30 mins. Drain and set aside.</li>
						<li>Bring 2 to 2 A½ liters water to a boil in a pot or a cooker. Add bay leaf and shahi jeera. You can also use cinnamon, cloves and cardamoms. If you do not like to get a bite of the spices in the rice, you can also tie these in a muslin cloth and add to the pot.</li>
						<li>Meanwhile, Heat 3 tbsp. oil in a biryani pot , handi or pan. Add sliced onions and fry evenly until golden.</li>
						<li>These onions lend a unique and authentic flavor, so do not skip these.</li>
						<li>When they turn dark brown, set aside  A¼ portion of these fried onions.</li>
						<li>When the water comes to a boil, add salt and drained rice and cook until al dente or 90 % done.</li>
						<li>While the rice cooks, let us make the chicken ready. To the rest of the onions, add 1 small bay leaf, star anise, A½ tsp shahi jeera, 3 cardamoms, 4 cloves. Saute just for a min without burning.</li>
						<li>Add 1 tbsp. ginger garlic paste.</li>
						<li>Saute on a medium flame until the raw smell of ginger garlic goes off.</li>
						<li>Add chicken</li>
						<li>Saute for 2 to 3 mins until the chicken turns white in color. Sprinkle salt.</li>
						<li>Add biryani masala, red chili powder, turmeric and green chilies. I use this homemade biryani masala. Just a reminder about the rice, do check it.</li>
						<li>Mix everything well and fry for 3 mins. After that cover and cook on a low flame for 3 to 4 mins for the chicken to release the moisture.</li>
						<li>Add 1 cup thick curd / yogurt.</li>
						<li>Stir, cover and cook on a medium flame until chicken is soft and tender.</li>
						<li>While the chicken cooks, check the rice. Drain off the rice to a colander when cooked to al dente. The rice must be 90 % cooked meaning you must feel the bite when you bite through a rice grain. Rice should be firm and grainy but not mushy.</li>
						<li>When the chicken is cooked completely, a thick gravy is left in the pot with oil separated. Check the salt now and add more if needed. Stir well and sprinkle chopped coriander and pudina leaves.</li>
						<li>Layer the rice over the chicken gravy. Sprinkle fried onions, pudina and coriander leaves. You can also add the optional ingredients â€“ pour the saffron soaked milk, ghee and kewra water evenly. For multilayer check the recipe card below.</li>
						<li>Cover the pot with a foil or a thick clean moist cloth.</li>
						<li>Cover with a air tight lid to trap the steam or dum. If you do not have a tight lid then you can place a heavy pot over the lid. You can mix 1 A½ cups atta with water and make a dough. Stick the dough to the rim of the lid. Press it off on to the pot, for a air tight seal. Place this pot on a hot tawa and cook for about 12 to 15 mins on a medium heat. Once done switch off and allow to rest for at least 20 mins.</li>
						<li>Aromatic biriyani is ready.</li>
