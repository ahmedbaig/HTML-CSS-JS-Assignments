		<p>This page was pasted in the About folder. Which is the Child Folder to the first folder -parent <q>Test Website-Links Explained</q> .</p>

		<p>The About page is formed in a completely different HTML file but linked in the <code>index.html</code> using relative url.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>Similarly If I had a folder within a I would need to specify full folder length like<br>
			<code>

				&#706a href="big blah / blah / file"&#707

			</code>
		</p>

		<p>Where big blah is parent folder and blah is child folder to the file.</p>

		<hr>

		<p>And if I need to go out again to previous folder from current folder I write like<br>
			<code>

				&#706a href="../ big blah / file"&#707

			</code>
		</p>

		<p>You can see how one <q> . . / </q> took you from blah (child folder) to big blah (parent folder)</p>
