			<h2>Images In HTML:</h2>
			<p>Images used in a site should always be relevant. Never pick an image which is not relevant and acts as a waste on your website.</p>

			<p>An image used on your website should always match the color scheme of your website. Nothing looks more horrible than mixed colors. </p>

			<p>If you cant decide where to find relevant images and google is not accurate enough for than you can use different other webise.<br>
				<sub>fair warning: things on some websites will not be free. Best if you steal images from code or google it.</sub></p>

			<p>Images are added on website by the &ltimg&gt tag.<br>
				In this &ltimg&gt tag there are some attributes that are much necessary. These are:
				<ol>
					<li>&ltsrc=" "&gt</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This is used as the location finder for your image-better known as source. Whether they are online someplace or offline on your computer.</li>
							<li>Online images are added by using the full address of the image. Example:<br>
								<code>&ltimg src="https://www.seeklogo.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/facebook-flat-vector-logo-400x400.png"&gt</code></li>
							<li>Offline images are added the same way links are added to seperate pages in website. Example:<br>
								<code>&ltimg src="images/fb_logo.png"&gt</code></li>
						</ul>
					<li>&ltalt=" "&gt</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This attribute is used to add an alternative text if the image fails to load or is missing from the location described.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>&ltwidth=" "&gt</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This is used if you want to size the width of your image but don't want to use css or photoshop.</li>
						</ul>
					<li>&ltheight=" "&gt</li>
						<ul>
							<li>This is used if you want to size the height of your image but don't want to use css or photoshop.</li>
						</ul>
				</ol>
